## Food Project: 
Add a new food.

Update food.

Delete food.

Search for any food title.

Get all the foods to show them.

Show all images in a slide show on home page.

Show details about any food.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result, get all images in slide show and can go to community and view all the foods.
You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[Show all the foods](http://localhost:3000/foods). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/foods/index.js`. 

[Show Details](http://localhost:3000/[id]). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/[foodId].js`. 

[Search for foods by title](http://localhost:3000/?search=?). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/index.js`. 

[Visit our community](http://localhost:3000/community). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/community/index.js`.

[API routes]

2-[edit-food](http://localhost:3000/edit-food/[id]). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/edit-food/[foodId].js`.
